# 👋 Hello, I'm Amit

I've been online since I was 9. My brain's a delightful buffet of design, engineering, science, and absurdity. I also spin a _mean_ Dapostar!

## 🚀 About Me

Digital tinkerer, hardware enthusiast, and community builder with a passion for exploring the boundaries between technology and human experience. I live at the intersection of physical and digital, bringing curious ideas to life through code, circuits, and critical thinking.

## 🤔 Design Philosophy (MONO)

I stripped away the distractions to focus on what matters: typography, layout, and form. What works in black and white works anywhere. It's like a minimalist's fever dream up in here.
